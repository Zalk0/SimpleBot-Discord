# Discord_SimpleBot

A simple Discord bot to begin using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).  
Be sure to have Python 3.8 or higher installed, as it is required by discord.py.

Clone the projet and install the requirements:

```
git clone https://github.com/Zalk0/Discord_SimpleBot.git
cd Discord_SimpleBot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
Before launching the bot, you have to create the **`token_discord`** file and put a Discord bot token inside.  
To have one, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create a new application.  
Then go to the Bot section and click the Reset Token button, you can now claim the token.

---
After having done all this you can launch the bot:

```
python main.py
```
